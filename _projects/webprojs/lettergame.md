this was a project I started as an assignment for my web development class in high school. it's not anywhere near complete, but I still think it's pretty cool :)

made entirely with javascript and html.

<b>notes------</b>

- wasd to move
- pressing g will bring up sample game dialogue
- pressing c will bring up sample char dialogue
- clicking dialogue box will skip typewriter anim
- pressing e will give a save code (in dev)
- frames around scenes (css) were left to show differences in generation
- saving the game is in rough dev right now
- if theres a letter on the ground the game will force you to pick it up before you are able to move again
- ^ that is because i will put an animation there, and it will be like a mini-game
