This game was designed by myself and Natalie Chang (CS Games '26, art/audio lead).<br/>
It was created with the support of the Annenberg Media team, as part of their new initiative to generate better viewer engagement through simple quick-play games.

You can play it <a href="https://www.uscannenbergmedia.com/games/">here</a>, on the Annenberg Games website.

<b>My Responsibilities:</b>

1. Taught myself the Godot workflow (first time using any game engine professionally)
2. Designed and implemented a <b>random terrain generator</b> that ensures every playthrough is different
3. Learned the basics of reloading scenes, saving data, and using <b>autoloads</b>
4. Created a <b>basic GUI</b> for game start, game over, and scoring
5. Ran small internal and external <b>playtests</b> to confirm completion of project milestones
6. Maintained <b>constant communication</b> between other member and Annenberg Media
7. Cleanly managed <b>Git collaboration</b> between members
