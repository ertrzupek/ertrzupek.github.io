Welcome! I'm a game designer and photographer with home bases in Los Angeles and Connecticut. I've been producing small game projects for a while now, starting with Minecraft plugins and mods in Java about 5 years ago.

I'm currently attending USC's Viterbi School of Engineering, studying computer science with an emphasis on video game design. I'm also minoring in photography with the goal of seeing the world from a more artistic lens.

Some of my favorite games include Hades, Balatro, Minecraft, and Stardew Valley.
