A puzzle game about shadow and light.

Made in a week for the 2025 Unreal MegaJam with 4 other USC Games students.

My Responsibilities:

1. Quickly prototyped multiple potential mechanics to experiment with different thematic ideas
2. Designed and connected all UI elements using both C++ and Blueprints
3. Planned tasks between members to ensure we stayed on track for the deadline
4. Organized meetings with 5 very different, very busy schedules
