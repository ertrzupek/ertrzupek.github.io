this game was designed by myself and Natalie Chang (CS Games '26, art/audio lead).<br/>
it was created with the support of the Annenberg Media team, as part of their new initiative to generate better viewer engagement through simple quick-play games.

you can play it <a href="https://www.uscannenbergmedia.com/games/">here</a>, on the annenberg games site.

<b>my responsibilities:</b>

1. taught myself the Godot workflow (first time using any game engine professionally)
2. designed and implemented a <b>random terrain generator</b> that ensures every playthrough is different
3. learned the basics of reloading scenes, saving data, and using <b>autoloads</b>
4. created a <b>basic GUI</b> for game start, game over, and scoring
5. ran small internal and external <b>playtests</b> to confirm completion of project milestones
6. maintained <b>constant communication</b> between other member and Annenberg Media
7. cleanly managed <b>git collaboration</b> between members
