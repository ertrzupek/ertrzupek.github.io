DISC WARS is my final project for the Unreal Gameplay class I took in Fall 2025!

Modeled after the "games" scene of Disney's <i>Tron: Legacy</i>, you play as a program of the Grid.

Win 5 games to win your freedom, or face permanent de-resolution.

Mechanics / Setup:

- Fully networked game system with host and join on main menu
- Immersive throw mechanic
  - Press LMB, physically swing/flick your mouse, then release!
- Custom projectile bounce
  - Hits two surfaces then becomes a honing projectile back to owner
- Networked breakable floors for a more dynamic arena
- Brief deflect shield with RMB
- Graceful disconnect back to main menu on game end
- Custom game mode & game state
- Custom character, player controller, and player state classes
- Custom projectile, weapon, and UI classes

Polish / Juice:

- Networked colors for player models, projectile model, and weapon-in-hand model
- Emissive strength fades on death
- Dynamic main menu
- VFX on projectile hit
- SFX for projectile movement and game announcements
- Default UI bullet indicator redesign
